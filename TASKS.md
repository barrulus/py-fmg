# Python Port Task Breakdown

Based on analysis of the Fantasy Map Generator (FMG) codebase and PLAN.md requirements, this document outlines the comprehensive task breakdown for porting FMG logic to Python.

## **Refined Implementation Strategy**

*   **Embrace Pythonic Solutions:** This is not a 1:1 port. Where Python's ecosystem offers a more performant or robust solution (e.g., NumPy, GeoPandas, existing libraries), we will favor it over a direct translation of JavaScript code.
*   **Test-Driven Development with Stage Gates:** The project will rely heavily on a rigorous testing framework. We will test each major generation stage against reference data exported from the original FMG to isolate deviations early.
*   **Focus on High-Risk Components:** The Voronoi graph adapter, hydrology simulation, and state expansion logic are the highest-risk modules and will receive priority and additional resources.

## Technical Challenges Identified

### Primary Challenges
- **Delaunator dependency**: ‚úÖ SOLVED - Successfully using `scipy.spatial.Voronoi`
- **Voronoi Graph Adaptation:** ‚úÖ SOLVED - Adapter layer converts scipy output to FMG structure
- **Cell Packing (reGraph):** ‚úÖ SOLVED - Full implementation with coastal enhancement

### Implementation Notes
- The Python port must maintain the FMG dependency chain while aggressively leveraging Pythonic libraries (NumPy, GeoPandas) for performance and simplicity.
- FMG uses a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline where each component builds on previous ones
- Python port must maintain this dependency chain while adapting to Python's geospatial ecosystem

## Success Criteria
- Generate maps comparable in quality to original FMG
- Meet performance targets: < 60s world generation, < 50ms spatial queries
- Successfully export all data to PostGIS with proper spatial indexing
- Support for future street-level detail expansion as outlined in PLAN.md
