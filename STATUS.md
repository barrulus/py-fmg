9. üöß Task 9: Heightmap Generation (80% - compatibility issues)

### Key Findings

#### Heightmap Generation Issues
1. **Seed Mismatch**: FMG can reuse a grid from one seed while generating heightmap with another seed
   - Grid seed: "651658815" (from saved map)
   - Heightmap seed: "854906727" (from browser session)
   - This creates inconsistency between Voronoi structure and height values

2. **Cell Packing**: FMG uses a `reGraph()` function that packs cells after heightmap generation
   - Original grid: 10,000+ cells
   - Packed result: ~4,500 cells (excludes deep ocean and some lake cells)
   - This is why our cell counts don't match

3. **Template Discovery**: FMG used "fractious" template (not originally in our implementation)
   - Added to our templates but still produces different results
   - Height ranges differ significantly (FMG: 4-100, Python: 10-100)

4. **Algorithm Differences**:
   - FMG has a bug in `getLinePower()` referencing undefined 'cells' variable
   - Blob spreading with power 0.98 should affect ~19% of cells mathematically
   - Our implementation affects 100% of cells (needs investigation)

### Next Steps
1. Implement `reGraph()` cell packing algorithm
2. Fix blob spreading algorithm to match FMG's behavior
3. Implement separate tracking for grid seed vs heightmap seed
4. Add remaining heightmap templates
5. Create proper compatibility layer for FMG save files

### Testing Results
- Voronoi generation: ‚úÖ Exact match
- Basic heightmap generation: ‚úÖ Working
- FMG compatibility: ‚ùå Only 5.2% exact matches
- Performance: ‚úÖ Fast generation (~1 second for 10K cells)

### Files Added Today
- `/fmg_analysis.md` - Detailed analysis of FMG's heightmap generation process
- `/heights.json` - FMG browser output data for debugging
- `/fmg_debug_patch.js` - JavaScript patch to intercept FMG operations
- `/test_fmg_manual.html` - Manual testing page
- `/playwright_trace_fmg.py` - Browser automation script
- Various test scripts for debugging heightmap generation

### Known Issues
1. Heightmap values don't match FMG output exactly
2. Cell packing (reGraph) not yet implemented
3. Some heightmap template commands not fully implemented (Mask with negative values)
4. Need to handle grid reuse with different seeds
