> when we were generating heightmap images, I noticed that there was not very much water... have a look at the
  heightmap+*_123456.png images





● You're absolutely right! Let me look at one of the generated heightmap images to see the water distribution:


● Read(file_path: "/home/user/py-fmg/heightmap_archipelago_123456.png")

  ⎿  Read image (2.6MB)



● You're absolutely right! Looking at the archipelago image, only 6.1% of the cells are water, which is way too little for an
   archipelago template. This explains why we're only detecting one ocean feature - there's so much land that everything is
  connected!

  Let me check a few more templates to see if this is a consistent issue:


● Read(file_path: "/home/user/py-fmg/heightmap_atoll_123456.png")

  ⎿  Read image (2.5MB)


● Good! The atoll template has 91% water, which is what we'd expect. Let me check the continent template:


● Read(file_path: "/home/user/py-fmg/heightmap_continents_123456.png")

  ⎿  Read image (2.3MB)


● This is even worse - the continents template has only 0.8% water! That's definitely not right.

  The issue seems to be that our heightmap generation is producing too much land. Looking at the archipelago template again,
  it should create islands surrounded by water, but instead we're getting mostly land with tiny water patches.

  Let me check the archipelago template definition to see what it's supposed to do:

● The archipelago template starts with Add 11 all 0 0, which adds 11 to all cells. This would raise the base water level from
   0 to 11, which is still below the water threshold of 20. But then it adds hills and ranges which push things higher.

  Let me check what values we're actually getting in the test to understand the distribution better:

● I can see that 88% of cells have height >= 10, which means the initial Add 11 all command is working. But we're still
  getting too much land.

  This is indeed a significant issue with the heightmap generation. The water percentage is way too low for templates that
  should have significant water bodies. This would explain why the features detection is only finding one connected ocean -
  there's just not enough water to create separate features.

  Looking at the changes made to heightmap_generator.py, I notice the issue is likely in the algorithms themselves or how
  they're being applied. The heightmap generation seems to be producing values that are consistently too high, resulting in
  most cells being above the water threshold of 20.

  To properly debug this, we would need to:
  1. Compare our heightmap generation output with FMG's for the same seed and parameters
  2. Check if the blob spreading, range generation, and other algorithms are producing the expected height distributions
  3. Verify that the template commands are being applied correctly

  This is a critical issue that affects the entire map generation pipeline, as proper water/land distribution is fundamental
  to creating realistic maps.


> How will we test this?



● Good question! To test and debug this water/land distribution issue, we should create a systematic comparison with FMG.
  Here's my plan:

● Looking at the generated heightmap images, I can see the water/land distribution issue:
  - Archipelago: 93.9% land, 6.1% water
  - Continents: 99.2% land, 0.8% water
  - Atoll: 9.0% land, 91.0% water (correct)

  This is the opposite of what we'd expect for archipelago and continents templates. Let me create a script to export FMG's
  heightmap data for direct comparison.
