## Heightmap Distribution Investigation

### Starting Point
- We had successfully matched FMG's maximum height (51) 
- But our minimum height was 15 vs FMG's 2
- Our distribution was significantly different from FMG's reference

### Key Discoveries

#### 1. Random Number Consumption ✅
- Confirmed that random consumption patterns match between Python and JavaScript
- Fixed integer coordinate calculations in `_get_point_in_range()` and `_get_number_in_range()`
- JavaScript's `rand()` returns integers, not floats

#### 2. ReGraph Implementation ✅ 
- Implemented FMG's `reGraph()` function for coastal resampling
- Creates new points list by:
  - Filtering out deep ocean cells (h < 20) except coastlines
  - Adding intermediate points between coastal neighbors
  - Running second Voronoi pass (TODO: needs actual Voronoi implementation)

#### 3. Critical Issue Found: Blob Spreading
- **Problem**: Our heightmap has only 839 ocean cells vs FMG's 1,057
- **Root Cause**: Blob spreading with power 0.98 is too aggressive
- A single hill at center affects ALL 10,000 cells!
- The command `Hill 6-7 25-35 20-70 30-70` raises the entire map above 20

#### 4. Algorithm Fix Applied
- Fixed blob spreading to match FMG exactly
- Cells can only be affected once per blob (no revisiting)
- Changed from `visited` set to checking `change[neighbor] > 0`

### Current Status

**What's Working:**
- Maximum height matches perfectly (51)
- Blob spreading algorithm now matches FMG's implementation
- ReGraph structure is in place

**What Needs Work:**
- Minimum height is 15 instead of 2
- Too few ocean cells (839 vs 1,057)
- Blob power 0.98 causes excessive spreading
- Need to implement Features.markupGrid() for proper cell classification
- Need actual second Voronoi pass in reGraph

### Files Created/Modified Today

**New Files:**

- `/debug/test_ocean_cells.py` - Ocean cell analysis
- `/debug/test_rand_function.py` - JavaScript rand() analysis
- `/debug/analyze_regraph_filtering.py` - ReGraph filtering analysis
- `/debug/trace_fmg_logic.py` - FMG logic tracing
- `/debug/test_specific_hill.py` - Blob spreading investigation
- `/debug/test_regraph_distribution.py` - Distribution testing
- `/py_fmg/core/regraph.py` - ReGraph implementation

**Modified Files:**
- `/py_fmg/core/heightmap_generator.py` - Fixed blob spreading algorithm
- `/py_fmg/api/main.py` - Added reGraph step to pipeline
- `/heightmap_bug_trace.md` - Added Phase 8 and post-processing details

### Next Steps for Tomorrow

1. **Investigate Blob Power Issue**
   - Why does power 0.98 cause entire map coverage?
   - Is there a max distance or step limit in FMG?
   - Should we be using a different power calculation?

2. **Implement Features.markupGrid()**
   - This is crucial for proper cell type classification
   - Affects which cells are kept during reGraph

3. **Fix Ocean Generation**
   - Need to understand why we start with height 15 instead of 2
   - May need to adjust initial height generation or template commands

4. **Complete ReGraph Implementation**
   - Implement actual second Voronoi pass with custom points
   - Currently using placeholder SimpleNamespace

### Key Insight
The distribution mismatch isn't in the reGraph filtering - it's earlier in the heightmap generation. Our blob spreading is too effective, creating a map with almost no ocean. We need to fix this core issue before the reGraph step can work correctly.
