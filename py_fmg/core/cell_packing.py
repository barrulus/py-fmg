"""
Cell packing (reGraph) functionality matching FMG's implementation.

This module implements FMG's reGraph() function which:
1. Filters out deep ocean cells
2. Adds intermediate points along coastlines
3. Creates a new packed Voronoi graph with fewer, more relevant cells

This is a critical performance optimization that reduces ~10,000 cells to ~4,500
by removing deep ocean while enhancing coastal detail.
