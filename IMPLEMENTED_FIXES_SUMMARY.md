# Implemented PRNG Fixes Summary

## Overview

All critical PRNG issues identified in the analysis have been successfully fixed. The Python port now properly implements FMG's random number generation patterns.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Blob Spreading Algorithm (✓ COMPLETED)

**File**: `py_fmg/core/heightmap_generator.py`

**Changes**:
- Changed `change` array from `np.uint8` to `np.float32` in `_add_one_hill()` method (line 231)
- Fixed the propagation check to use the actual float value instead of truncated integer (lines 274-280)
- Fixed pit generation to not limit initial h value (line 309)

**Impact**: Blob spreading now correctly propagates with fractional values, matching FMG's behavior.

### 2. Implemented PRNG Reseeding in Heightmap Generator (✓ COMPLETED)

**File**: `py_fmg/core/heightmap_generator.py`

**Changes**:
- Added seed parameter to `__init__` method with PRNG reseeding (lines 34-60)
- Updated `from_template()` to properly reseed and get fresh PRNG instance (lines 883-887)

**Impact**: Heightmap generation now starts with consistent PRNG state, matching FMG's reseeding at heightmap-generator.js:68.

### 3. Added PRNG Reseeding to Voronoi Graph Generation (✓ COMPLETED)

**File**: `py_fmg/core/voronoi_graph.py`

**Changes**:
- Added PRNG reseeding at start of `generate_voronoi_graph()` (lines 423-426)

**Impact**: Graph generation now reseeds PRNG, matching FMG's behavior at graphUtils.js:19.

### 4. Added PRNG Reseeding to Features Module (✓ COMPLETED)

**File**: `py_fmg/core/features.py`

**Changes**:
- Added seed parameter to `Features.__init__()` with optional reseeding (lines 44-64)

**Impact**: Features module can now reseed PRNG when needed, matching FMG's features.js:31.

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- **PRNG Consistency**: Same seed produces identical results across runs ✓
- **Blob Spreading**: Correctly spreads with fractional values to 1024 cells ✓
- **PRNG State Tracking**: Reseeding produces identical sequences ✓

## Key Improvements

1. **Deterministic Map Generation**: The Python port now generates identical maps for the same seed
2. **Correct Blob Spreading**: Features spread naturally with proper decay curves
3. **PRNG State Consistency**: Each pipeline stage starts with the correct PRNG state

## Remaining Considerations

While the core PRNG issues are fixed, you may want to:
1. Add the seed parameter to any map generation pipeline entry points
2. Ensure rivers and provinces modules also reseed when implemented
3. Consider adding debug logging for PRNG state tracking during development

The Python port should now produce maps much closer to FMG's output for the same seeds!
