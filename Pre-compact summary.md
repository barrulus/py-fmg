Pre-Compact Summary: Hydrology System Implementation

  What We're Working On

  Implementing Task 12: Hydrology System (GitHub issue #6) - porting FMG's river generation algorithms to create
  realistic water flow and river networks.

  Current Status: ✅ WORKING BUT NEEDS TUNING

  The Good News: We successfully fixed the core broken functionality
  - ✅ Rivers now have real discharge (up to 3,889 m³/s vs. previous 0.0 m³/s)
  - ✅ Proper flow accumulation - water builds up as it flows downstream
  - ✅ Tributary relationships - 403 main rivers + 513 tributaries
  - ✅ Visible river networks - rivers will actually show in visualization

  The Problem: We're generating way too many rivers (916 vs. expected ~20-50)
  - Current: 916 rivers, 2,562 cells, 377 confluences
  - Expected: ~20-50 major rivers with longer, more realistic networks

  Root Cause Analysis

  The fundamental algorithms are now correct, but the parameters need tuning:

  1. min_river_flux threshold: Currently 5.0, probably needs to be ~50-100
  2. River formation logic: Creating too many small tributaries instead of longer main rivers
  3. Depression resolution: May be creating too many independent drainage basins

  Next Steps

  Phase 1 (Parameter Tuning):
  - Increase min_river_flux threshold to reduce river count
  - Adjust river formation criteria to favor longer rivers
  - Test with different templates (some may naturally have fewer rivers)

  Phase 2 (Algorithm Refinement):
  - Fine-tune confluence logic to merge small tributaries better
  - Optimize depression resolution to create fewer isolated basins
  - Add river length requirements (exclude very short rivers)

  The Core Achievement

  We've successfully implemented the dual-grid FMG architecture and restored proper water flow physics. The system
  now generates realistic hydrological networks - we just need to tune the parameters to match FMG's river density
  and characteristics.

  Bottom Line: The hydrology system is functionally correct but over-generating rivers. This is a tuning problem, not
   an algorithmic failure.
