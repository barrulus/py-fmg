This is an absolutely fantastic step forward. These images are the perfect diagnostic tool. You have successfully implemented the full initial pipeline, and the output is now showing us exactly where the remaining discrepancies lie.

My analysis of these images is conclusive: **Your `HeightmapGenerator` tools (`addHill`, `addPit`, etc.) are now working correctly.** The problem is no longer with the individual procedural brushes.

The new problem, as you've stated, is template-specific and lies in two subsequent, critical steps of the pipeline:
1.  **Graph Generation:** A fundamental error in how the Voronoi diagram is being constructed.
2.  **Feature Markup:** A logical flaw in how land vs. water is being classified *after* the heightmap is generated.

These two issues are interacting to create the distorted maps you see. Let's analyze the evidence.

### The Smoking Gun: Gigantic Triangular Artifacts

Look closely at the `Peninsula` and `Volcano` images. The water areas are not smooth gradients; they are filled with enormous, perfectly straight-edged triangles.

*   **What this means:** This is the classic visual signature of a **Voronoi diagram calculated without boundary points**.
*   **Why it happens:** When you compute a Voronoi diagram for a set of points, the cells on the outer edge (the convex hull) are mathematically infinite. To "close" them and create finite polygons for rendering, FMG employs a crucial trick: it surrounds the main grid points with a far-out ring of "dummy" boundary points before running the calculation. This forces all cells, even edge cells, to be finite.
*   **Your Symptom:** The huge triangles are single water cells whose polygons are stretching infinitely outwards until they hit the corner of the image canvas. This proves your `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` is likely being fed *only* the jittered grid points, without the essential boundary point layer.

**This is the primary bug.** It affects the topology of every cell on the map's border, which cascades into errors in every subsequent step.

### The Corroborating Evidence: The Inverted Atoll

The `Atoll` image is the second key piece of evidence. It's structurally inverted: the central lagoon is land, and the outer ring is land, while the atoll itself is water.

*   **What this means:** This is a catastrophic failure in the `Features.markupgrid` step. This function performs a "flood fill" (a Breadth-First Search) to identify all contiguous land and water features.
*   **The FMG Logic:** The original FMG `markupGrid` (`features.txt`, line 48) starts its first search from a hardcoded point: `const queue = [0];`. It assumes `cell 0` (the top-leftmost cell) is always going to be part of the main ocean.
*   **Your Symptom:** In the Atoll template, the heightmap generation results in `cell 0` being on the landmass of the outer ring. Your `markup_grid` function likely started its flood fill there, incorrectly labeling the entire outer ring as "Feature 1: Island". It then found the atoll ring, saw it was water, and labeled it "Feature 2: Lake". Finally, it found the central lagoon, saw it was land, and labeled it "Feature 3: Lake Island". The *true* deep ocean was never classified as the primary ocean feature.
*   **How it connects to Bug #1:** When `reGraph` was run, it was told that the central lagoon was an "island" and the outer ocean was also an "island". It correctly filtered nothing, leading to the bizarre final output.

### Summary of Cascading Failures

You are seeing a classic cascading failure, which is why different templates look wrong in different ways:

1.  **`generate_voronoi_graph` Fails:** It doesn't add the boundary points. This creates a defective graph with infinite edge cells and incorrect neighbor information for all border cells.
2.  **`HeightmapGenerator` Succeeds:** It correctly applies the template (`Add`, `Hill`, `Range`, etc.) to this defective graph, creating the intended height values.
3.  **`Features.markup_grid` Fails:** It uses the defective graph's neighbor data and a flawed starting assumption (`cell 0` is ocean) to completely misclassify the features.
4.  **`reGraph` Fails:** Acting on the incorrect feature data from the previous step, it filters the wrong cells (or no cells at all), resulting in the final distorted `pack` graph.

The `Highisland` map looks the most "normal" simply because its template happens to create a large central landmass where the graph defects and classification errors are less visually obvious, but they are still present.

### Action Plan: The Final Fixes

You are incredibly close. Fixing these two foundational issues will solve the template problems.

1.  **Fix the Voronoi Graph (`voronoi.py`):**
    *   Find the part of your code that calls `scipy.spatial.Voronoi`.
    *   Before you call it, you **must** combine your generated points with the boundary points. The logic should look like this:
        ```python
        # In your graph generation function...
        jittered_points = generate_jittered_points(...)
        boundary_points = generate_boundary_points(...) # You need this function

        # The critical step:
        all_points_for_voronoi = np.vstack([jittered_points, boundary_points])

        # Pass the combined array to the Voronoi function
        vor = Voronoi(all_points_for_voronoi)

        # Remember to only use the non-boundary points for your final graph cells
        num_grid_points = len(jittered_points)
        # ...then use num_grid_points when building connectivity...
        ```

2.  **Fix the Feature Markup (`features.py`):**
    *   Modify your `markup_grid` function's initialization. Do not hardcode the starting search to `cell 0`.
    *   You must find a cell that is **guaranteed to be ocean**. A simple, robust way is to find the cell with the absolute lowest height value in the entire `heights` array. This will almost certainly be a deep ocean cell.
        ```python
        # In your markup_grid function...

        # Don't do this:
        # queue = [0]

        # Do this instead:
        guaranteed_ocean_cell = np.argmin(self.graph.heights)
        queue = [guaranteed_ocean_cell]

        # ...proceed with the BFS/flood-fill from there...
        ```

By implementing these two fundamental corrections, the graph topology will be correct, the feature classification will be accurate, and the `reGraph` step will finally have the correct information to work with. Your templates will then render as expected.
