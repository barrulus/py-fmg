# Blob Spreading Fix Summary

## The Critical Bug

The issue was that we were using `float32` arrays instead of `uint8` arrays for the `change` map. This prevented the integer truncation that is ESSENTIAL to FMG's blob spreading algorithm.

## The Fix

1. Changed `change = np.zeros(self.n_cells, dtype=np.float32)` to `dtype=np.uint8`
2. Ensured we check the STORED (truncated) value: `if change[neighbor] > 1:`

## How It Works (from blob_algo.md)

The spreading algorithm relies on three key mechanisms:

1. **Integer Truncation**: When a float like `1.87` is stored in a `Uint8Array`, it becomes `1`
2. **Guard Clause**: `if (change[neighbor])` prevents revisiting cells
3. **Termination Check**: `if (change[neighbor] > 1)` uses the STORED integer value

The integer truncation creates a natural stopping point. When the decay formula produces values between 1 and 2, they get truncated to 1, failing the `> 1` check and stopping propagation in that direction.

## Results

### Before Fix:
- Hills spread to ALL 10,010 cells
- Max spread distance: 100-120+ cells
- Entire map covered by each hill

### After Fix:
- Hills spread to 1,000-2,500 cells (realistic)
- Max spread distance: 50-85 cells
- Proper localized features

## Why This Design?

The integer truncation creates the "plateau effect" where hills have relatively flat tops that suddenly drop off at the edges. This creates more realistic terrain than a smooth mathematical decay would produce.

## Remaining Questions

We're still using ~490x more PRNG calls than expected. This might be because:
1. The "~25 calls" observation might be incorrect
2. FMG might have additional optimizations we're missing
3. Our PRNG call counting might be including other operations

The spreading behavior is now correct, which is the most important fix.
