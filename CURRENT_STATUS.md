# Python Fantasy Map Generator (py-fmg) - Current Status

## Project Overview

Python port of the Fantasy Map Generator (FMG) with PostGIS backend and FastAPI REST interface. The project now includes a complete implementation of FMG's terrain generation, feature detection, climate simulation, hydrology, and biome classification systems.

## Current Features

### Core Functionality
- **Complete Voronoi Generation**: Full FMG-compatible Voronoi graph generation with Lloyd's relaxation
  - ~42% improvement in point distribution uniformity
  - Configurable iteration count (default: 3)
  - Heights array pre-allocated during grid creation for stateful operations

- **Grid Management**
  - Support for "keep land, reroll mountains" workflow matching FMG's interactive design
  - `should_regenerate()` method on VoronoiGraph for intelligent reuse
  - `generate_or_reuse_grid()` function for workflow optimization

- **Cell Packing (reGraph)**: Performance optimization that reduces ~10,000 cells to ~4,500
  - Cell type classification (inland, coast, deep ocean)
  - Deep ocean filtering for performance
  - Grid index mapping for data transfer between packed/unpacked grids

- **Coastal Enhancement**: Automatic addition of intermediate points along coastlines

- **Heightmap Generation**: Full suite of terrain generation algorithms
  - Hills, pits, ranges, straits implementation
  - PRNG synchronization through fixed-order operations
  - FMG blob spreading with accurate quirks handling
  - Proper interpolated terrain visualization

- **Feature Detection**: Complete geographic feature analysis
  - Ocean/land classification based on height thresholds
  - Lake and coastline detection with connectivity analysis
  - Island identification and classification
  - Distance field calculations for coast proximity

- **Climate System**: Comprehensive climate simulation
  - Latitude-based temperature bands (tropical, temperate, polar)
  - Altitude-based temperature adjustments (6.5°C per 1km)
  - Wind patterns matching real-world circulation (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies)
  - Precipitation modeling with orographic effects and rain shadows
  - Moisture transport simulation from coasts

- **Hydrology System**: River and drainage basin generation
  - Flux-based river routing following terrain gradients
  - Automatic sink filling for proper drainage
  - River confluence detection and merging
  - Basin delineation and watershed analysis

- **Biome Classification**: Complete ecosystem determination
  - Temperature and precipitation-based classification
  - Support for all major biome types (tropical rainforest, desert, tundra, etc.)
  - Smooth transitions between biome zones
  - Altitude-adjusted biome assignments

- **Template Support**: Named templates for quick map generation

- **API Interface**: FastAPI REST endpoints for map generation
  - Main pipeline endpoint for complete generation
  - Support for template-based generation
  - Comprehensive visualization stages (1-8)

### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostGIS backend integration for spatial operations
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with seed-based reproducibility
- **Documentation**: API documentation and detailed technical reports

## Recent Accomplishments

### Major Feature Implementations
- **Climate System**: Complete implementation with temperature, wind, and precipitation modeling
- **Hydrology System**: Full river generation with flux-based routing and basin delineation
- **Biome Classification**: Comprehensive biome assignment based on climate variables
- **Feature Detection**: Complete geographic feature analysis including lakes, islands, and coastlines
- **Visualization Pipeline**: 8-stage visualization system showing progression from terrain to biomes

### Bug Fixes
- **PRNG Desynchronization**: Fixed heightmap generation order to ensure deterministic results
- **Blob Spreading**: Implemented FMG's exact blob spreading algorithm including its quirks
- **Cell Connectivity**: Proper handling of border cells in graph building
